# AWS External Account Scanner

> Xenos, is Greek for stranger.

AWSXenos will list all the trust relationships in all the IAM roles, and S3 buckets, in an AWS account and give you a breakdown of all the accounts that have trust relationships to your account. It will also highlight whether the trusts have an [external ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html) or not.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html

This tool reports against the [Trusted Relationship Technique](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1199/) of the ATT&CK Framework. 

* For the "known" accounts list AWSXenos uses a modified version of [known AWS Accounts](https://github.com/fwdcloudsec/known_aws_accounts).
* For the Org accounts list, AWSXenos will query AWS Organizations.
* AWS Services are classified separately.
* Everything else falls under unknown account
* For regional services, e.g. KMS, you'll need to run AWSXenos per region.

## Why

Access Analyzer falls short because:

1. You need to enable it in every region. 

2. Identified external entities might be known entities. E.g. a trusted third party vendor or a vendor you no longer trust. An Account number is seldom useful. 

3. Zone of trust is a fixed set of the AWS organisation. You wonâ€™t know if a trust between sandbox->prod has been established. 

4. Does not identify AWS Service principals. This is mainly important because of [Wiz's AWSConfig, et al vulnverabilities](http://i.blackhat.com/USA21/Wednesday-Handouts/us-21-Breaking-The-Isolation-Cross-Account-AWS-Vulnerabilities.pdf)

## How to run

### Cli
```sh
pip install AWSXenos
awsxenos --reporttype HTML -w report.html
awsxenos --reporttype JSON -w report.json
```
You will get an HTML and JSON report.

See [example report](example/example.html)

You can configure the services you care about by using [your own config](awsxenos/config.yaml).

### Library

```python
from awsxenos.scan import PreScan
from awsxenos.report import Report
from awsxenos.s3 import S3
#from awsxenos.iam import IAM

prescan = PreScan()
aws_service = S3()
findings = aws_service.fetch(prescan.known)
r = Report(s.findings, s.known_accounts_data)
json_summary = r.JSON_report()
html_summary = r.HTML_report()
```

### IAM Permissions

Permissions required.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "iam:ListRoles"
        "organizations:ListAccounts",
        "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
        "s3:GetBucketPolicy",
        "s3:GetBucketAcl",
        "iam:ListRoles",
        "kms:ListKeys",
        "kms:GetKeyPolicy",
        "secretsmanager:ListSecrets",
        "secretsmanager:GetResourcePolicy",
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Development

```sh
python3 -m env venv
source /env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Create a file with the name of the service.
2. Create a class with the name of the resource that you want from that service
3. Your class must inherit from `Service` and return `Findings`

Example: 

```python
class S3(Service):

    def fetch(self, accounts: DefaultDict[str, Set] ) -> Findings:
        self._buckets = self.list_account_buckets()
        self.policies = self.get_bucket_policies()
        return super().collate(accounts, self.policies)
```
4. Add your filename and class to the config
