# AWS External Account Scanner

> Xenos, is Greek for stranger.

AWSXenos will list all the trust relationships in all the IAM roles, and S3 buckets, in an AWS account and give you a breakdown of all the accounts that have trust relationships to your account. It will also highlight whether the trusts have an [external ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html) or not.

This tool reports against the [Trusted Relationship Technique](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1199/) of the ATT&CK Framework. 

* For the "known" accounts list AWSXenos uses a modified version of [known AWS Account IDs](https://github.com/rupertbg/aws-public-account-ids).
* For the Org accounts list AWSXenos query AWS Organizations.
* AWS Services are classified separately.
* Everything else falls under unknown account

## Why

Access Analyzer falls short because:

1. You need to enable it in every region. 

2. Identified external entities might be known entities. E.g. a trusted third party vendor or a vendor you no longer trust. An Account number is seldom useful. 

3. Zone of trust is a fixed set of the AWS organisation. You wonâ€™t know if a trust between sandbox->prod has been established. 

4. Does not identify AWS Service principals. This is mainly important because of [Wiz's AWSConfig, et al vulnverabilities](http://i.blackhat.com/USA21/Wednesday-Handouts/us-21-Breaking-The-Isolation-Cross-Account-AWS-Vulnerabilities.pdf)


## How to run

### Cli
```sh
pip install AWSXenos
awsxenos --reporttype HTML -w report.html

from awsxenos.scan import Scan
from awsxenos.report import Report

s = Scan()
r = Report(s.findings, s.known_accounts_data)
json_summary = r.JSON_report()
html_summary = r.HTML_report()
```

### IAM Permissions
