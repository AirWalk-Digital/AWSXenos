# AWS External Account Scanner

> Xenos, is Greek for stranger.

AWSXenos will list all the trust relationships in all the IAM roles, and S3 buckets, in an AWS account and give you a breakdown of all the accounts that have trust relationships to your account.

This tool reports against the [Trusted Relationship Technique](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1199/) of the ATT&CK Framework. 

* For the "known" accounts list AWSXenos uses https://github.com/rupertbg/aws-public-account-ids.
* For the Org accounts list AWSXenos query AWS Organizations.
* AWS Services are classified separately.
* Everything else falls under unknown account

## Why

Access Analyzer falls short because:

A. You need to enable it in every region. 

B. Identified external entities might be known entities. E.g. a trusted third party vendor or a vendor you no longer trust. An Account number is seldom useful. 

C. Zone of trust is a fixed set of the AWS organisation. You wonâ€™t know if a trust between sandbox->prod has been established. 

D. Does not identify AWS Service principals. This is mainly important because of [Wiz's AWSConfig, et al vulnverabilities](http://i.blackhat.com/USA21/Wednesday-Handouts/us-21-Breaking-The-Isolation-Cross-Account-AWS-Vulnerabilities.pdf)


Tools like [ScoutSuite](https://github.com/nccgroup/ScoutSuite/blob/db827e3d8e36e3bc7adcb8c62f2453960353c2ef/ScoutSuite/providers/aws/rules/findings/iam-assume-role-lacks-external-id-and-mfa.json) can uncover the external trusts that don't have MFA.
[Dome9](https://gsl.dome9.com/D9.AWS.IAM.61.html) can discover if there are conditions, associated.

The list goes on, however:
1. A malicious external trust can have MFA or a condition attached.
2. The accounts could be from within the AWS Organization, from a known provider (see [accounts.json](awsxenos/accounts.json)), or unknown
3. The checks helps you organise and verify if you still have a need for these trusts and if new trusts are introduced.


## How to run

### Cli
```sh
pip install AWSXenos
awsxenos --reporttype HTML -w report.html
```
You will get a JSON output and an HTML report.
See (example report)[example/example.html]

### Library

```python
from awsxenos.scan import Scan
from awsxenos.report import Report

s = Scan()
r = Report(s.findings, s.known_accounts_data)
json_summary = r.JSON_report()
html_summary = r.HTML_report()
```

### IAM Permissions

Policy should like this.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "iam:ListRoles"
        "organizations:ListAccounts"

      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

```sh
python3 -m env venv
source /env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
